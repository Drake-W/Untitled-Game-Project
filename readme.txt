Fall 2019 Game Programming class project, open ended

My project is a simple start to an adventure/collector/builder game. Currently there is an island that the player can walk around and pick up wood from bushes and rocks. I built the island with assets from the RPG poly pack and added scripts and colliders where needed. The player is from the character pack listed below, it had a character control script and animator available but I wrote my own so that it would work with the mouse click method of movement instead of keyboard based movement. The next steps would be making it possible to place an object down to build it with the rocks and wood collected. 

Controls:	Left click - walk to a specific point
		Hold left click - follow the mouse
		Right click - pick things up
		Scroll Wheel - zoom in and out
		A and D - rotate the camera


Assets used: 	Gigel's RPG poly pack - lite
		Supercyan's Character Pack: Free Sample
Both obtained from the unity asset store
